      <h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 29-11-2024</p>
      <p>
        At <strong>Web Magic</strong>, we currently do not offer shipping or delivery services as our 
        platform does not involve the sale of physical products. This policy is provided for clarity 
        regarding our current operations.
      </p>

      <h2>1. No Shipping or Delivery Services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We operate entirely in the digital space, and all products or services provided 
          through our platform are accessible online.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a result, no shipping or delivery processes are applicable at this time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Future Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Should our offerings expand to include physical products or services that 
        require shipping, this policy will be updated to reflect the necessary details.
      </p>
